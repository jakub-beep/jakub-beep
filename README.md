# Experience 

## Professional experience
I've got over 2 years experience in software development, which I gained in 2 companies.
Mostly I've been working as a fullstack developer.
I've taken part in projects, which were responsible for delivering:
- websites:
  * website for renting and selling apartments
  * website for a marketing agency
- internal apps:
  * app for a bank which was designed to help employees in everyday work
- protoypes:
  * app which would eventually become a platform for communication between patients and pharmacies

## Extra projects
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css,wasm)](https://skillicons.dev)
- Website for student's oranization PUT SOLAR DYNAMICS
As a former member of a team I am responsible for maintaning website, which I created as an actual member of the team.
The website was created with the most basic technologies (like vanilla JS) to make it easy-maintanable, easy-understandable
and to be sure that these technologies will be supported in the future.
