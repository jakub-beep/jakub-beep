### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± My name is Jakub and I am from Poland. 
Currently I devote my time between:
ðŸ’¼ working as CAD Designer 
ðŸ’» studying application of Internet of Things at Adam Mickiewicz University in PoznaÅ„.

:red_car:  Currently I am part of students organization that works on building solar cars. These cars are using electric engines and PV panels to use some natural power resources.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently spending my time on learning Electronics and perfecting my skills in programming microcontrollers.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help in both electronics so I can learn faster and exploring new ideas
- ðŸ˜„ Iâ€™m interested in broadly understood technology, science and mathematics. In private I also do many various things such as numerous types of activities and reading books. I am also fond of cooking some delicious food.

# Experience 

## Working in company
<p align="left"> <a href="https://www.forcom.com.pl/pl/home/" target="_blank"> <img src="https://scontent.fpoz3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/241107790_293747682555203_1435001992508893606_n.png?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=09cbfe&_nc_ohc=JvrS0W3EDosAX_izOsL&_nc_ht=scontent.fpoz3-1.fna&oh=ac830b455c7e9f0760512f9787b0be45&oe=619E7ED3" alt="Forcom" width="40" height="40"/> </a> </p>
At the moment I have finished my first work in programming industry. I have been working for Forcom organization as a C# programmer. I also used both .NET and SQL as well as worked with some APIs mainly using REST. Gained a lot of experience while spending my time there.

## PUT Solar Dynamics organization
I also have a couple of projects that I have been a part of inside of the PUT Solar Dynamics organization. I have been responsible for carring out ECM project that has been fully implemented as main controller inside of CAN communication iterface of the car. I also have been a part of MPPT project and currently I am also working on Dashboard project as well as new Telemetry project that is going to be implemented in new car.

Aside from programming experience I also am responsible for project management because I am one of the seniors in PUT Solar Dynamics organization so I spent a lot of time in means to implement new solutions and solve problems. 

## University projects
As a student I also have gathered some experience in Electronics because I have made twilight sensor and sensor for detecting cables. I worked on image processing project that has been a part of my Digital Technologies subject inside of which we simply used logic gates and other components inside of logisim to make desired image on the output. I have experience in working with matlab and python for simulation of dynamic systems and as for python I also have been working with it for some data science. I also have done a couple of C++ project for my studies in one of which I had implemented A* algorithm inside of the OpenGL rendered game.
